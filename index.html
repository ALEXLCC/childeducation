<p>How are children’s lives changing and what role do child psychologists have in supporting children? Child psychology is a broad area, covering how people change as they grow up from birth through to adolescence and trying to explain how these important changes occur – are 3-year-olds, 7-year-olds and teenagers different just because of their experiences of the world, or because of biological changes within the individual?
儿童生活如何变化的？心理学家在支持儿童方面起到什么作用？儿童心理学是一个宽广的领域，覆盖了人的成长从他们从出生到青年成长，而且尽量解释在3岁，7岁和少年变化的不同是如何发生的，或者因为他们世界的经历不同，或者因为他们个体的生理变化不同。
*<em>Using theories to understand development *</em>
Like all fields of scientific research ,child psychology is characterised by different perspectives and theroies ,which have shaped how our understanding of development have changed over time .There are many differnet theories to describe children's development ,but here we focus on just two .Some theroies argue that development must occur primarily through factors internal to the child that are biologically generated .In contrast ,other theories consider environmental factors ,such as the child's social environment ,to be more important in stimulating and supporting development.</p>

<ul>
<li>development is primarily internal : Piaget(Swiss psychologist)
Piaget:

<em>Piaget was especially interested in how children became able to form mental representations of the world and felt that _
_cognitive development proceeds through a series of predefined biological steps that are stimulated through physical _
_interaction with the world. This theory predicts that all children across the world should go through these stages in the _
_same order and around the same time, regardless of differences in the environment that they are growing up in.</em>
</li>
<li>development is determined by environmental factors: Vygotsky ( Soviet psychologist; Vygotsky was the founder of cultural-historical psychology).

<em>Piaget set the tone for much of current-day research but his theory has also received a great deal of criticism. Many believe that Piaget ignored the huge influence that society and culture have in shaping a child’s development. At a similar time, another researcher named Lev Vygotsky (1896–1934) had come to similar conclusions as Piaget about children’s development, in thinking that children learned about the world through physical interaction with it. However, where Piaget felt that children moved naturally through different stages of development, based on biological predispositions and their own individual interactions with the world, Vygotsky claimed that adult or peer intervention was a much more important part of the developmental process. Vygotsky concentrated more on the child’s immediate social and cultural environment and his or her interactions with adults and peers. He argued that development occurred first through children’s immediate social interactions, and then moved to the individual level as they began to internalise their learning. While Piaget saw the child as actively discovering the world through individual interactions with it, Vygotsky saw the child as more of an apprentice, learning through a social environment of others who had more experience and were sensitive to the child’s needs and abilities.</em>

### How does socio-cultural context influence development?
<em>Children grow up in specific physical, social, cultural, economic and historical circumstances (their socio-cultural context), all of which will influence their childhood. Research has shown that children’s socio-cultural context can have a large influence on their development. We know that culture influences how children develop; across different cultures, children develop in quite different ways (Montgomery, 2008). And we know that children who are deprived of contact with their mothers can often experience difficulties in later childhood because of poor attachment bonds (Bowlby, 1980). Development of course involves a process of learning and improvement, and children can only learn when others are there to support them, like parents, teachers and siblings. This does not conflict with Piaget’s stage theory but does extend it to explain how some of the environmental experiences that children receive can allow them to move from one stage to another, in line with Vygotsky’s socio-cultural approach.</em>

<p><em>A lot of research focuses on the external influences that shape children’s development and treats them as relatively powerless. But of course children have a role in their own development and in selecting the sorts of environmental influences they are exposed to. Even newborns select what to pay attention to by where they look and how they orient themselves (usually towards the smell of milk!). Infants will often try to elicit certain behaviours from adults by giving them cues, such as covering their eyes to play peek-a-boo. Indeed, infants’ sensitivity to very subtle communicative cues and their role in social interaction is surprisingly sophisticated. Aspects specific to the child such as their temperament can also greatly influence how adults and other children interact with them.** Once children begin to speak they often drive conversations – expecting responses from adults or asking questions**. And when children begin to engage in imaginary play from around 2 years of age they often take on new personas and roles that help them make sense of different aspects of their world or deal with things that they are frightened of (Howes and Matheson, 1992), for instance by pretending to be a superhero fighting off monsters. By the time children reach school age they have begun to make many decisions about their environment, such as who to be friends with and what interests to pursue.</em></p>

<a id="education-settings" class="anchor" href="#education-settings" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Education Settings</h3>

<p>As the video suggests, educational psychologists work closely with a child’s parents or carers as well as those offering support in schools, such as the special educational needs coordinators (SENCOs), to help maximise the support that can be offered for children and young people in educational contexts. Educational psychologists must be aware of how changes in a child’s behaviour might indicate a more serious problem such as abuse or bullying, and are responsible for ensuring that appropriate action is taken. The psychologist can assess the child using standardised tests. A standardised test is one that is administered and scored in a consistent manner across all children. Using standardised scores, educational psychologists can assess how an individual child’s development is progressing compared to that of other children in their age group. Educational psychologists often use a range of measures to identify and diagnose specific learning difficulties and make suggestions for interventions in the classroom and school generally.</p>

<h3>
<a id="clinical-settings" class="anchor" href="#clinical-settings" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Clinical settings</h3>

<p>Clinical psychologists study, assess and treat a wide range of biological, psychological and social problems that children and young people may experience in their personal lives. This might involve the assessment of individuals to find out what they are struggling with, interventions that support individuals to cope with that difficulty or prevention programmes that stop them suffering. Clinical psychologists also consult with other professionals to offer as holistic a support structure for individuals as possible.
Similarly to educational psychologists, clinicians often use diagnostic tests to identify children who are at risk of having some kind of developmental disorder, such as autism or ADHD, or even to assess the progress of children who have suffered physical or mental damage. By understanding how children of a certain age typically perform on a set of tasks, clinical psychologists can identify symptoms of developmental disorders to ensure, to the best of their ability, that the child is given appropriate support as early as possible.</p>

<a id="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h1>

<p>This course has briefly introduced you to some of the main ideas that are central to child psychology, with a particular focus on early development. Child psychology tries to describe and explain all aspects of child development, including changes in children’s cognitive, social and physical development, and to understand and support children experiencing delays in their development. Some of the dominant theories about children’s development have been introduced; competing explanations focus on development within the individual as against development influenced by the wider social and cultural environment. These theories often seek to answer a number of important psychological questions, which include explaining how change occurs, the role of the socio-cultural environment and how children shape their own individual development. These can often influence the kinds of applied work that psychologists carry out, such as in clinical or educational settings.</p>
